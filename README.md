# WP Content AI

A content management and generation system for WordPress websites.

## Features

- Website management
- Content generation
- WordPress integration
- Content calendar
- Post themes management
- Sitemap parsing and content import
- Key content analysis and reference

## Primary Content Feature

The application now supports designating a piece of content as "primary" for each website. This primary content is used as the base for generating content writing prompts.

### How it works:
1. In the Website Content Manager, each content item has a Primary Content column
2. Click the circle icon to set a content item as primary (indicated by a green checkmark)
3. Only one content item per website can be primary at a time
4. The database automatically ensures this constraint through a trigger

### Implementation Details:
- The `website_content` table has an `is_primary` boolean column (default: false)
- A database trigger ensures only one content item per website can be marked as primary
- The SQL script to add this feature is available in `add_is_primary_column.sql`

## Key Content System

### What is Key Content?
Key content represents the most important, high-quality pages on your website. These pages serve as:
- Foundation for your website's content strategy
- Examples of your ideal content style and structure
- Reference material for AI-generated content

### How It Works

1. **Marking Key Content**
   - In the content manager, mark your best pages as key content
   - These should be well-written, comprehensive pages that represent your desired content quality

2. **Updating Key Content**
   When you click "Update Key Content", the system:
   - Extracts and analyzes the writing style, tone, and structure from your key pages
   - Identifies patterns in content organization, vocabulary, and formatting
   - Creates a content profile that will guide future content generation

3. **Content Generation**
   The analyzed key content influences new content by:
   - Matching the writing style and tone
   - Following similar content structure patterns
   - Maintaining consistent terminology and industry-specific language
   - Ensuring new content aligns with your established content quality

### Best Practices

- Choose 3-5 pages as key content
- Select content that best represents your desired style and quality
- Update key content regularly to maintain freshness
- Ensure key pages cover your main topics or services

### Tips for Selecting Key Content

1. Look for pages that:
   - Are comprehensive and well-written
   - Represent your brand voice accurately
   - Cover core topics in your niche
   - Have performed well with your audience

2. Common types of key content:
   - Detailed guides or tutorials
   - Core service/product pages
   - Key industry resources
   - Foundational topic overviews

## Setup

### Database Setup

Before running the application, you need to set up the database tables. Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Create post_themes table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS post_themes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  website_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES websites(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  subject_matter TEXT NOT NULL,
  keywords TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'generated', 'published')),
  scheduled_date TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add RLS policies
ALTER TABLE post_themes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy for selecting post_themes (users can only see themes for websites they have access to)
CREATE POLICY select_post_themes ON post_themes
  FOR SELECT USING (
    website_id IN (
      SELECT w.id FROM websites w
      JOIN user_profiles up ON up.organisation_id = w.organisation_id
      WHERE up.id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Policy for inserting post_themes
CREATE POLICY insert_post_themes ON post_themes
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    website_id IN (
      SELECT w.id FROM websites w
      JOIN user_profiles up ON up.organisation_id = w.organisation_id
      WHERE up.id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Policy for updating post_themes
CREATE POLICY update_post_themes ON post_themes
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    website_id IN (
      SELECT w.id FROM websites w
      JOIN user_profiles up ON up.organisation_id = w.organisation_id
      WHERE up.id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Policy for deleting post_themes
CREATE POLICY delete_post_themes ON post_themes
  FOR DELETE USING (
    website_id IN (
      SELECT w.id FROM websites w
      JOIN user_profiles up ON up.organisation_id = w.organisation_id
      WHERE up.id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS post_themes_website_id_idx ON post_themes(website_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS post_themes_subject_matter_idx ON post_themes(subject_matter);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS post_themes_status_idx ON post_themes(status);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS post_themes_scheduled_date_idx ON post_themes(scheduled_date);

-- Add trigger to update the updated_at timestamp
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
   NEW.updated_at = NOW();
   RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ language 'plpgsql';

CREATE TRIGGER update_post_themes_updated_at
  BEFORE UPDATE ON post_themes
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE update_updated_at_column();
```

Additionally, you need to set up the sitemap function by running the following SQL:

```sql
-- Function to fetch and parse a website's sitemap
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_website_sitemap_pages(website_id UUID)
RETURNS TABLE (
  id UUID,
  website_id UUID,
  url TEXT,
  title TEXT,
  last_fetched TIMESTAMPTZ
) LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER AS $$
DECLARE
  website_url TEXT;
  sitemap_url TEXT;
  sitemap_content TEXT;
  sitemap_found BOOLEAN := FALSE;
  common_sitemap_paths TEXT[] := ARRAY[
    '/sitemap.xml',
    '/sitemap_index.xml',
    '/sitemap-index.xml',
    '/wp-sitemap.xml',
    '/sitemap/sitemap-index.xml'
  ];
BEGIN
  -- Get the website URL
  SELECT url INTO website_url FROM websites WHERE id = website_id;
  
  IF website_url IS NULL THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Website with ID % not found', website_id;
  END IF;
  
  -- Remove trailing slash if present
  IF website_url LIKE '%/' THEN
    website_url := substring(website_url from 1 for length(website_url) - 1);
  END IF;
  
  -- Try common sitemap paths
  FOREACH sitemap_url IN ARRAY common_sitemap_paths LOOP
    BEGIN
      -- Attempt to fetch the sitemap
      SELECT content INTO sitemap_content 
      FROM http_get(website_url || sitemap_url);
      
      -- If we got here without an exception, we found a sitemap
      sitemap_found := TRUE;
      EXIT;
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
        -- Continue to the next path
        CONTINUE;
    END;
  END LOOP;
  
  -- If no sitemap was found, return empty result
  IF NOT sitemap_found THEN
    RETURN;
  END IF;
  
  -- Parse the sitemap XML and extract URLs
  -- First, check if it's a sitemap index
  IF sitemap_content LIKE '%<sitemapindex%' THEN
    -- Process sitemap index (get first sitemap in the index)
    WITH sitemap_urls AS (
      SELECT 
        unnest(xpath('//sitemap/loc/text()', xmlparse(content sitemap_content))) AS sitemap_loc
    )
    SELECT content INTO sitemap_content 
    FROM http_get(sitemap_urls.sitemap_loc::text)
    FROM sitemap_urls
    LIMIT 1;
  END IF;
  
  -- Now process the actual sitemap
  RETURN QUERY
  WITH sitemap_urls AS (
    SELECT 
      unnest(xpath('//url/loc/text()', xmlparse(content sitemap_content))) AS url_loc,
      unnest(xpath('//url/lastmod/text()', xmlparse(content sitemap_content))) AS url_lastmod
  )
  SELECT 
    uuid_generate_v4() AS id,
    website_id,
    url_loc::text AS url,
    -- Extract title from URL (last path segment)
    COALESCE(
      nullif(regexp_replace(
        split_part(url_loc::text, '/', -1), 
        '\.html$|\.php$|\.asp$|\.aspx$', 
        ''
      ), ''),
      'Homepage'
    ) AS title,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS last_fetched
  FROM sitemap_urls;
END;
$$;

-- Add comment to the function
COMMENT ON FUNCTION get_website_sitemap_pages(UUID) IS 'Fetches and parses a website sitemap to extract pages';

-- Grant execute permission to authenticated users
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_website_sitemap_pages(UUID) TO authenticated;
```
